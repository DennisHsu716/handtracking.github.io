# Hand Tracking
## Summary
MediaPipe is a cross-platform machine learning framework developed by Google, designed for implementing features 
such as hand tracking, face detection, and pose estimation. By utilizing MediaPipe with Python, developers can 
swiftly create machine learning-based applications that incorporate these functionalities. The development process 
involves reading images or video streams, applying MediaPipe's processing modules, and visualizing or further 
analyzing the results. When paired with Python, developers can efficiently deploy pre-built models through 
its streamlined API and integrate with tools like OpenCV for data processing and visualization. The versatility 
of Python facilitates the integration of MediaPipe with other tools, allowing for data post-processing and the 
creation of interactive applications.

## About the future plans
Applying image recognition technology in medical settings can facilitate real-time observation and analysis of patient behavior. By installing camera devices, the system can identify patients' daily movements, changes in posture, or abnormal behaviors, such as falls, prolonged immobility, or other hazardous situations, and immediately alert medical staff. Additionally, this technology can be utilized for long-term behavioral tracking, providing valuable data to support patient recovery progress and detect signs of disease. This solution not only alleviates the monitoring burden on medical staff but also enhances patient safety and healthcare efficiency. It is particularly well-suited for elderly care or patient populations that require close monitoring.
