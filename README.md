# üß† AI Image Recognition
## üìå Summary  
This project demonstrates a real-time image recognition system utilizing MediaPipe and Python. MediaPipe, developed by Google, offers a cross-platform framework ideal for implementing machine learning features such as hand tracking, pose estimation, and face detection. Combined with Python‚Äôs flexibility and libraries like OpenCV, the system enables efficient image and video stream processing with real-time gesture detection and visualization
## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment & Tools  
* Language: Python
* Libraries:
    * mediapipe ‚Äì for hand tracking and image processing  
    * cv2 (OpenCV) ‚Äì for camera capture and visualization  
    * math ‚Äì for geometric computations
      
    import cv2
    import mediapipe as mp
    import math
## Usage
Through the computer's camera, hand movements can be detected in real-time, allowing for the distinction of various gestures.

## About the future plans
Applying image recognition technology in medical settings can facilitate real-time observation and analysis of patient behavior. By installing camera devices, the system can identify patients' daily movements, changes in posture, or abnormal behaviors, such as falls, prolonged immobility, or other hazardous situations, and immediately alert medical staff. Additionally, this technology can be utilized for long-term behavioral tracking, providing valuable data to support patient recovery progress and detect signs of disease. This solution not only alleviates the monitoring burden on medical staff but also enhances patient safety and healthcare efficiency. It is particularly well-suited for elderly care or patient populations that require close monitoring.
