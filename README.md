# 🧠 AI Image Recognition
## 📌 Summary  
This project demonstrates a real-time image recognition system utilizing MediaPipe and Python. MediaPipe, developed by Google, offers a cross-platform framework ideal for implementing machine learning features such as hand tracking, pose estimation, and face detection. Combined with Python’s flexibility and libraries like OpenCV, the system enables efficient image and video stream processing with real-time gesture detection and visualization
## ⚙️ Environment & Tools  
* Language: Python
* Libraries:
    * mediapipe – for hand tracking and image processing  
    * cv2 (OpenCV) – for camera capture and visualization  
    * math – for geometric computations
```    
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import math
```
## 🎯 Usage  
Using a computer webcam, the system detects hand movements in real time. It can identify and differentiate between various gestures, providing a foundation for applications like gesture-based control systems or sign language recognition.

## 🚀 Future Plans: Medical Applications  
The technology can be expanded to serve healthcare environments in the following ways:  
* **Patient Monitoring:** Detect posture changes, inactivity, or abnormal behavior (e.g., falls) and notify staff immediately.  
* **Elderly Care:** Track movement patterns and raise alerts in hazardous situations.  
* **Recovery Support:** Collect behavioral data over time to assess rehabilitation progress.  
* **Healthcare Efficiency:** Reduce manual monitoring workload for medical personnel while enhancing patient safety.
By integrating computer vision into healthcare systems, this project aims to contribute to safer, smarter, and more responsive care environments.
