# Hand Tracking
## Summary
MediaPipe is a cross-platform machine learning framework developed by Google, designed for implementing features 
such as hand tracking, face detection, and pose estimation. By utilizing MediaPipe with Python, developers can 
swiftly create machine learning-based applications that incorporate these functionalities. The development process 
involves reading images or video streams, applying MediaPipe's processing modules, and visualizing or further 
analyzing the results. When paired with Python, developers can efficiently deploy pre-built models through 
its streamlined API and integrate with tools like OpenCV for data processing and visualization. The versatility 
of Python facilitates the integration of MediaPipe with other tools, allowing for data post-processing and the 
creation of interactive applications.
